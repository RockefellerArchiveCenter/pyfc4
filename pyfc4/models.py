# Resource
class Resource(object):

	'''
	Linked Data Platform Resource (LDPR)
	A HTTP resource whose state is represented in any way that conforms to the simple lifecycle patterns and conventions in section 4. Linked Data Platform Resources.

	'''

# RDF Source
class RDFResource(Resource):

	'''
	Linked Data Platform RDF Source (LDP-RS)
	An LDPR whose state is fully represented in RDF, corresponding to an RDF graph. See also the term RDF Source from [rdf11-concepts].

# Container
class Container(RDFResource):
	
	'''
	Linked Data Platform Container (LDPC)
	A LDP-RS representing a collection of linked documents (RDF Document [rdf11-concepts] or information resources [WEBARCH]) that responds to client requests for creation, modification, and/or enumeration of its linked members and documents, and that conforms to the simple lifecycle patterns and conventions in section 5. Linked Data Platform Containers.
	https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/
	'''

# Basic Container
class BasicContainer(Container):
	
	'''
	Linked Data Platform Basic Container (LDP-BC)
	An LDPC that defines a simple link to its contained documents (information resources) [WEBARCH].
	https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/

	https://gist.github.com/hectorcorrea/dc20d743583488168703
		- "The important thing to notice is that by posting to a Basic Container, the LDP server automatically adds a triple with ldp:contains predicate pointing to the new resource created."

# Direct Container
class DirectContainer(Container):
	
	'''
	Linked Data Platform Direct Container (LDP-DC)
	An LDPC that adds the concept of membership, allowing the flexibility of choosing what form its membership triples take, and allows members to be any resources [WEBARCH], not only documents.
	https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/

	When adding children, can also write relationships to another resource

	'''
	pass


# Indirect Container
class IndirectContainer(Container):
	
	'''
	Linked Data Platform Indirect Container (LDP-IC)
	An LDPC similar to a LDP-DC that is also capable of having members whose URIs are based on the content of its contained documents rather than the URIs assigned to those documents.
	https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/
	'''
	pass


# NonRDF Source
class NonRDFResource(Resource):

	'''
	Linked Data Platform Non-RDF Source (LDP-NR)
	An LDPR whose state is not represented in RDF. For example, these can be binary or text documents that do not have useful RDF representations.
